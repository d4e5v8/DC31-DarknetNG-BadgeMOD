# DC31-DarknetNG-BadgeMOD

These are my MODs for the Defcon darknet-NG badge.

I am a true Noob in 3D, so the designs have been created using the original .stl files at:
https://github.com/darknet-ng/Darknet-NG-12-Badge/tree/main

I have been looking for efficiency, not precision, using TinkerCAD.

If someone more skilled wants to improve... feel free!

How to assemble:
- I used 4 2mmx35mm M2 screws, using washers on both side and nuts.
- Use the two plates for sandwhiching the to pieces of the body

Please refrain for copying the color model (I used black, white and orange)... be creative!!!
