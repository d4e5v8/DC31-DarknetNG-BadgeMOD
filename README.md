# DC31-DarknetNG-BadgeMOD

These are my MODs for the Defcon darknet-NG badge.

I am a true Noob in 3D, so the designs have been created using the original .stl files at:
https://github.com/darknet-ng/Darknet-NG-12-Badge/tree/main

I have been looking for efficiency, not precision, using TinkerCAD.

If someone more skilled wants to improve... feel free!

How to assemble:
- Re-drill the 4 holes using a 2mm (sorry guys, the metric system is the way to go!) on the body parts and plates
- I used 4 2mmx35mm M2 screws, using washers on both sides and nuts.
- Use the two plates for sandwiching the two pieces of the body, adding to the look and securing the front and back

Please refrain from copying the color model (I used black, white, and orange)... be creative!!!
